# ASP.net Devloper Guide

There are two options to run this project

 **First Method**
1. Make sure to have Visual Studio 2026 insiders installed
2. This version has .NET version 10 and the project should work from there on

**Second Method**

1. If you would like to use VSCode make sure to install .NET 10 from the microsoft page
2. To test if you actually have it installed go into the terminal and type `dotnet --version`


I find just installing visual studio 2026 to be 10x easier and its good to learn how to use visual studio as it is a great IDE imo.
