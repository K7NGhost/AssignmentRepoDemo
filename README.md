------------------ Fill in some information about your project under this ------------------

The project is a calorie intake tracker. 
The calorie tracker will determine the calories of a food by user input (pictures).
The system will detect the calories of the input using artificial intelegence and machine learning models. 
The front end will be built using react js. The backend will be built using Node.js. The database will be built using supabase or mongoDB.
